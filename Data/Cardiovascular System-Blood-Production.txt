Recall that blood is a connective tissue. Like all connective tissues, it is made up of cellular elements and an

extracellular matrix. The cellular elements—referred to as the formed elements—include red blood cells (RBCs),
white blood cells (WBCs), and cell fragments called platelets. The extracellular matrix, called plasma, makes
blood unique among connective tissues because it is fluid. This fluid, which is mostly water, perpetually suspends
the formed elements and enables them to circulate throughout the body within the cardiovascular system.

Functions of Blood : The primary function of blood is to deliver oxygen and nutrients to and remove wastes from body cells, but that is
only the beginning of the story. The specific functions of blood also include defense, distribution of heat, and
maintenance of homeostasis.
Transportation : Nutrients from the foods you eat are absorbed in the digestive tract. Most of these travel in the bloodstream directly
to the liver, where they are processed and released back into the bloodstream for delivery to body cells. Oxygen
from the air you breathe diffuses into the blood, which moves from the lungs to the heart, which then pumps it out
to the rest of the body. Moreover, endocrine glands scattered throughout the body release their products, called
hormones, into the bloodstream, which carries them to distant target cells. Blood also picks up cellular wastes and
byproducts, and transports them to various organs for removal. For instance, blood moves carbon dioxide to the
lungs for exhalation from the body, and various waste products are transported to the kidneys and liver for excretion
from the body in the form of urine or bile.
Defense : Many types of WBCs protect the body from external threats, such as disease-causing bacteria that have entered the
bloodstream in a wound. Other WBCs seek out and destroy internal threats, such as cells with mutated DNA that
could multiply to become cancerous, or body cells infected with viruses.
When damage to the vessels results in bleeding, blood platelets and certain proteins dissolved in the plasma, the
fluid portion of the blood, interact to block the ruptured areas of the blood vessels involved. This protects the body
from further blood loss.
Maintenance of Homeostasis : Recall that body temperature is regulated via a classic negative-feedback loop. If you were exercising on a warm
day, your rising core body temperature would trigger several homeostatic mechanisms, including increased
transport of blood from your core to your body periphery, which is typically cooler. As blood passes through the
vessels of the skin, heat would be dissipated to the environment, and the blood returning to your body core would
be cooler. In contrast, on a cold day, blood is diverted away from the skin to maintain a warmer body core. In
extreme cases, this may result in frostbite.
Blood also helps to maintain the chemical balance of the body. Proteins and other compounds in blood act as
buffers, which thereby help to regulate the pH of body tissues. Blood also helps to regulate the water content of
body cells.


Composition of Blood : You have probably had blood drawn from a superficial vein in your arm, which was then sent to a lab for analysis.
Some of the most common blood tests—for instance, those measuring lipid or glucose levels in plasma—determine
which substances are present within blood and in what quantities. Other blood tests check for the composition of
the blood itself, including the quantities and types of formed elements.
One such test, called a hematocrit, measures the percentage of RBCs, clinically known as erythrocytes, in a blood
sample. It is performed by spinning the blood sample in a specialized centrifuge, a process that causes the heavier
elements suspended within the blood sample to separate from the lightweight, liquid plasma (Figure 18.2). Because
the heaviest elements in blood are the erythrocytes, these settle at the very bottom of the hematocrit tube. Located
above the erythrocytes is a pale, thin layer composed of the remaining formed elements of blood. These are the
WBCs, clinically known as leukocytes, and the platelets, cell fragments also called thrombocytes. This layer is
referred to as the buffy coat because of its color; it normally constitutes less than 1 percent of a blood sample.
Above the buffy coat is the blood plasma, normally a pale, straw-colored fluid, which constitutes the remainder of
the sample. 
The volume of erythrocytes after centrifugation is also commonly referred to as packed cell volume (PCV). In
normal blood, about 45 percent of a sample is erythrocytes. The hematocrit of any one sample can vary significantly,
however, about 36–50 percent, according to gender and other factors. Normal hematocrit values for females range
from 37 to 47, with a mean value of 41; for males, hematocrit ranges from 42 to 52, with a mean of 47. The
percentage of other formed elements, the WBCs and platelets, is extremely small so it is not normally considered
with the hematocrit. So the mean plasma percentage is the percent of blood that is not erythrocytes: for females, it
is approximately 59 (or 100 minus 41), and for males, it is approximately 53 (or 100 minus 47).
The cellular elements of blood include a vast number of erythrocytes and comparatively fewer
leukocytes and platelets. Plasma is the fluid in which the formed elements are suspended. A sample of blood spun in a centrifuge reveals
that plasma is the lightest component. It floats at the top of the tube separated from the heaviest elements, the erythrocytes, by a buffy
coat of leukocytes and platelets. Hematocrit is the percentage of the total sample that is comprised of erythrocytes. Depressed and
elevated hematocrit levels are shown for comparison.

Characteristics of Blood : 
When you think about blood, the first characteristic that probably comes to mind is its color. Blood that has just
taken up oxygen in the lungs is bright red, and blood that has released oxygen in the tissues is a more dusky red.
This is because hemoglobin is a pigment that changes color, depending upon the degree of oxygen saturation.
Blood is viscous and somewhat sticky to the touch. It has a viscosity approximately five times greater than water.
Viscosity is a measure of a fluid’s thickness or resistance to flow, and is influenced by the presence of the plasma
proteins and formed elements within the blood. The viscosity of blood has a dramatic impact on blood pressure and
flow. Consider the difference in flow between water and honey. The more viscous honey would demonstrate a
greater resistance to flow than the less viscous water. The same principle applies to blood.
The normal temperature of blood is slightly higher than normal body temperature—about 38 °C (or 100.4 °F),
compared to 37 °C (or 98.6 °F) for an internal body temperature reading, although daily variations of 0.5 °C are
normal. Although the surface of blood vessels is relatively smooth, as blood flows through them, it experiences
some friction and resistance, especially as vessels age and lose their elasticity, thereby producing heat. This
accounts for its slightly higher temperature.
The pH of blood averages about 7.4; however, it can range from 7.35 to 7.45 in a healthy person. Blood is therefore
somewhat more basic (alkaline) on a chemical scale than pure water, which has a pH of 7.0. Blood contains
numerous buffers that actually help to regulate pH.
Blood constitutes approximately 8 percent of adult body weight. Adult males typically average about 5 to 6 liters of
blood. Females average 4–5 liters.
